<h3 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect1">I.
Introduction</a></h3>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect1">
The primary goal of this project is to let students get some experience with the design and implementation of networked
applications and protocols, including how to format data and use sockets. Through this project, students will also gain hands-on experience with measuring network performance, concurrent software design, and I/O handling.<br>
</a></p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect1">In
this project, you are to develop a "ping-pong" client program and a server program. The "ping-pong" client and the server together are used to measure the network's performance in transmitting messages of various sizes.
Further details are described in </a><a href="project1.html#sect2">Section II</a>.<br><br>

In addition to responding
to your "ping-pong" client's messages, your server should have an
alternate execution mode in which
it acts as a simple web server. This functionality is described in <a href="project1.html#sect4">Section IV</a>. Your server must be able to handle
multiple concurrent connections from "ping-pong" clients in the default mode or web browsers in the "www" mode.<br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"> </p>

<h3 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect2">II.
The Ping-Pong Client and Server (60 points)<br>
</a></h3>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect2">
The "ping-pong" client program should take 4 command line parameters, in the
following order:</a></p>
<ul style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
  <a name="sect2"> <li><em>hostname</em>
    <blockquote>The host where the server is running. You should
support connecting to a server by domain name (current list of CLEAR servers: ring.clear.rice.edu, sky.clear.rice.edu, glass.clear.rice.edu, water.clear.rice.edu).</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><em>port</em>
    <blockquote>The port on which the server is running (on CLEAR, the usable range is 18000 &lt;= port &lt;= 18200).</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><em>size</em>
    <blockquote>The size in bytes of each message to send (10 &lt;= size &lt;= 65,535).</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><em>count</em>
    <blockquote>The number of message exchanges to perform (1 &lt;= count &lt;= 10,000).</blockquote>
  </li>
  </a>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect2">The
server program should take 1 mandatory parameter and 2 optional parameters, in
the following order:</a></p>
<ul style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
  <a name="sect2"> <li><em>port</em>
    <blockquote>The port on which the server should run (on CLEAR, the usable range is 18000 &lt;= port &lt;= 18200).</blockquote>
  </li>
  </a><li><a name="sect2"><em>mode</em> (optional)
    </a><blockquote><a name="sect2">The mode of the server. If this is "www", then the
server should run in web server mode (described in </a><a href="project1.html#sect4">Section
IV</a>). If it is anything else, or left out, then the server should
run in ping-pong mode.</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><em>root_directory</em> (required for www mode)
    <blockquote>This is the directory where the web server should look
for documents. If the server is not in web server mode, ignore this
parameter. (e.g. /home/student/comp429/project1/html)<br>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  
</ul>

<a name="sect3" style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"> </a>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect3">The
ping/pong message should be formatted as follows, with the first byte starting from the left:</a></p>
<table style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="5%">size (2 bytes)</td>
      <td width="10%">timestamp tv_sec (4 bytes)</td>
      <td width="10%">timestamp tv_usec (4 bytes)</td>
      <td width="20%">data (size - 10 bytes)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect3">The
size and the two timestamp fields are numeric values and therefore should be stored in network-byte order in the message. The data portion can contain arbitrary byte values of your choice. The size lets
the receiver of the message know how much data there is to read from the socket to completely receive the message.</a></p>


<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect2">
The "ping-pong" client should establish a SOCK_STREAM
connection
with the server. Once the connection is established, the client should
send
a "ping" message to the
server. Upon receiving the "ping" message, the server should reply with
that same message without modifying its content, a.k.a. a "pong" message, immediately. The client waits for the
reply, then repeats such message exchange for "count" number of times, then closes the connection. The client should
measure the latency of each such exchange and printf() to the screen the average latency of the exchanges (expressed in millisecond, with up to 3 decimal places of precision) and then terminate.<br><br>

In order to measure latency, the client should use gettimeofday() to obtain the current time before sending a ping message and put it as a timestamp in the ping message. gettimeofday() fills in a struct timeval, which consists of two 32bit fields, tv_sec and tv_usec, the second and microsecond components of the time since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970. See "man gettimeofday" for details.
Subsequently, when a pong message is received, the timestamp embedded in the pong message can be compared to the current time (again, use gettimeofday()) to compute the latency experienced by this ping-pong exchange.
</a></p>
<a name="sect3" style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"> </a>

<h3 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect3">III.
Measurement - Mandatory for COMP/ELEC 556; Optional for COMP/ELEC 429 (15 points)<br>
</a></h3>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect3">

The ping-pong client/server measures the total latency of transferring
the specified amount of data twice, once from the client to the
server, and once from the server to the client. The data transfer
latency measured can be decomposed into two components: (1) data size
and bandwidth dependent transmission delay (which is approximated by
data size divided by network link bandwidth), and (2) data size and
bandwidth independent delay caused by the time it takes for data to
physically propagate over the length of network links, the time
overhead of making software function calls, etc.; this bandwidth
independent delay exists no matter how high the underlying network
link bandwidth is.

Using your ping-pong client/server, if you measure the time it takes
to send 65,535 bytes of data between two CLEAR servers, you might find
that it takes nearly 1.5ms per iteration on average (this figure is
approximate, your exact measurement may vary). If you perform the
calculation for the data transmission rate achieved, you'll get
(65535*2*8)/0.0015 bps or 699 Mbps. That is a rather low achieved
transmission rate given the underlying network links are 1000 Mbps
(i.e. 1 Gbps). The main reason for the low achieved transmission rate
is that a lot of that 1.5ms is coming from the bandwidth independent
delay.
</P>

<p  style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
For this part of the assignment, design and write up a method for
measuring this bandwidth independent delay across two CLEAR servers as
accurately as possible using only the ping-pong client/server software
you have developed; no change to the software is allowed. Because you
are limited by the ping-pong client/server's design, you will not be
able to obtain a perfect answer; instead, the goal is to estimate the
bandwidth independent delay as closely as possible. You should then
perform the corresponding measurements according to your method using
your ping-pong client/server, and report your estimate of this
bandwidth independent delay. Finally, use this estimated bandwidth
independent delay to adjust your estimate of the true bandwidth of the
network link. You must clearly show your measurement results and
calculations in your write-up.
</p>

<p  style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
The grading of this part will depend on the method design and the
underlying reasoning to support your method, as well as your actual
measurements and calculations. That means your grade heavily depends
on the write-up. Logical reasoning and precise wording in the write-up
are expected. Your write-up document should be a PDF file named
"part3.pdf".
</p>

<h3 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect4">IV.
The Web Server (40 points)<br>
</a></h3>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect4">When
the server's optional <em>mode</em> parameter is set
to "www", the server should run in web server mode. In this mode, the
server
should answer HTTP GET requests from web browsers. The server should
open
files relative to the root directory specified as a parameter to the
server,
in order to respond to GET requests. The full specification for HTTP
can
be seen at </a><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/</a>.
Because HTTP is an extremely complicated protocol, we only expect you
to implement a subset, described <a href="project1.html#httpoverview">here</a>.</p>
<h4 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Special Cases</h4>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"> Note that you
want all requests to be restricted to under the root directory. This
means you should disallow requests containing "../" path elements which
could potentially cause the server to send documents not under the root
directory. You can allow symbolic links which leave the specified root,
since the user explicitly put them there and knows what to expect.
Return an error message with code 400 if "../" appears
in the path. <br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">If a file is not
found, you need to return an appropriate HTTP error code and message.
How you handle directories is largely up to you; you can return a
file-not-found message, a more specialized error message, or convert
the request to index.html within the specified directory. It is <b>NOT</b>
OK to just open the directory as a file and return the contents.<br>
</p>
<a name="sect5" style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"> </a>
<h3 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect5">V.
Administrivia</a></h3>
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect5">Failure to adhere to the following rules may result in a zero grade for your project.<br><br> 
You may form a group of up to 3 students to work on this project. If you need assistance finding group-mates, email the instructor as soon as possible.
<br>
<br>
You are allowed to use the sample C programs and Makefile provided by the instructor as starting points for your project.<br>
<br>To
facilitate the grading process you must put your work under a
directory
called project1, then create a tar archive of it (i.e. tar cvzf project1.tar.gz project1). Submit the tar archive to Canvas. One submission per group is enough, unless there is a special situation such as members of a group want to submit on different days due to slip day usage differences. <br>
</a></p><p style="font-family: times new
roman,times,serif;"><a name="sect5"> In the project1 directory, in
addition to any software code files, there must be a file entitled
README which states the names of the students who worked together on
the project, and documents how you tested your client and server, any
known problems, and anything the graders should know. Also, include
your "part3.pdf" document as appropriate. You must use <em>make</em>
to build your project. There must be a Makefile in the project
directory, and running make in the project directory must build both
the client and the server. The grading will be done on CLEAR, so make
sure that your code works on CLEAR. If your code does not compile with
make on CLEAR, you may receive a zero grade. </a></p><a name="sect5">
<p style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">You must write
your programs in C and use the Linux networking API.</p>

<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for
distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP has
been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since
1990. The first version of HTTP, referred to as HTTP/0.9, was a simple
protocol for raw data transfer across the Internet. HTTP/1.0 improved
the protocol by allowing messages to be in the format of MIME-like
messages, containing meta information about the data transferred and
modifiers on the request/response semantics. Latest HTTP Version is
1.1, which is documented in RFC 2616; version 1.0 is documented in RFC
1945.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">HTTP operates
over TCP connections, usually to port 80, though this can be overridden
and another port used. After a successful connection, the client
transmits a request message to the server, which sends a reply message
back. HTTP messages are human-readable.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The simplest
HTTP request message is "GET url", to which the server replies by
sending the named document. If the document doesn't exist, the server
will send an error message stating this.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The format for
GET command is "GET url HTTP/version". The client may then send
additional header fields, one per line, terminating the message with a
blank line. The server replies in a similar vein, first with a series
of header lines, then a blank line, then the document proper.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Here a sample
HTTP 1.1 exchange represented using strings in the C programming
language:</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">

<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">HTML document body
follows</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Simply
speaking, HTTP protocol operates in 4 steps:</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Step 1 'CONNECTION':
Web browser (the client) try to connect to the web server using socket.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Step 2 'REQUEST':
Web client sends its request via the established socket. Here we only
consider the request using GET command. The format for GET command is:</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"GET path/file
HTTP/version \r\n\r\n"</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">the 'path/file'
indicates the requested file; 'HTTP/version' specifies the HTTP version
used by browser.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Step 3 'RESPONSE':
After the server receives the request, it will do some necessary
processing then send back the results to clients. Then, the client can
display the requested web page. For example, if the client wants to
visit the webpage www.mycomputer.com:80/mydir/index.html, it will send
a GET command: GET /mydir/index.html HTTP/1.1 to the server. The
webserver with domain name www.mycomputer.com will search for
'index.html' from its subdirectory 'mydir'.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The server needs to
send the client some necessary information regarding the requested
file. So the server will first transmit some HTTP header followed by
the document body. HTTP header is separated from the document body by a
blank line.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Some useful HTTP
header message:</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">1)"HTTP/1.1 200 OK
\r\n"</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">This is the first
line of the response of the server, which lists the HTTP version and
response code. The response code "200 OK" means the request is
successful. Other return codes are as follows:</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">200 OK</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">

</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">This specifies the
MIME type of the HTTP body, e.g., Content-Type: text/html means that
the data sent is a HTML document. You only need to support text/html in
your server. You do not need to deal with any other type. A blank line
"\r\n" is then sent, followed by the document body.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
</div>
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">

<span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">Needless to
say, the aspect of HTTP we are concerned with in this project is a
very tiny subset of the HTTP protocol. If you want to see the full
gory detail of the HTTP protocol, you may wish to observe real HTTP
protocol traffic generated from your own computer by using a traffic
analysis tool like "wireshark" as you use your web browser. Note that
you cannot do this on CLEAR servers because it requires administrative
privilege. </span><br style="font-family: times new
