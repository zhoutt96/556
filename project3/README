Usage
    ● How to build:
    Type "make" on the command line under the same path of the "makefile" file to build the
    project.
    If you want to clean the file, type "make clean".
  
Notes
    ● our test strategy description is in the same path of the "makefile" file, named test.txt
    ● our designed test case in the "testcases" directory and
        "my_pingpong_test" is testing ping/pong protocol
        "my_whole_test" is testing the whole LS/DV protocol
    ● when the test case become complicate, the time interval should be enough to let DV protocol update.
