COMP/ELEC 429/556 Project 2: Reliable File Transfer Protocol


Team Members:

How to build:
	Type "make" on command line under the same path of the "makefile" file to build the project.
	If you want to clean the file, type "make clean".

How to run execute:
	Type "./sendfile -h" to view the usage of sendfile
	Type "./recvfile -h" to view the usage of recvfile

UDP Packet:
	Packet Structure:
		The first packet which contains the filename and file count:
			20 byte - filename
			4 byte - count
		Data packet:
			32bit - Sequence Number
			32bit - Acknowledgement Number
			//4bit  - Header Length
			16bit - header checksum
			16bit - window size
			16bit - payload checksum
			1400 byte payload

	Packet Size:
		In this project, we set the maximum packet size with 1400Bytes.
		The absolute limitation on TCP packet size is 64K (65535 bytes),
		but in practicality this is far larger than the size of any packet you will see,
		because the lower layers (e.g. ethernet) have lower packet sizes.
		The MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) for Ethernet, for instance, is 1500 bytes. (reference from ...????)

Data Flow Control Algorithm:
Sliding Window(More explaination on slide:reliability)
	window size: we set the default window size as 64KB(65,535bytes), without any window size scaling here.

Error Detections Algorithm:
1â€™s Complement Checksum (More explaination on slide:reliability)

Retransmit Algorithm:
Fast Retransmit Algorithm
